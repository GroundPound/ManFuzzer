# The ManFuzzer

The ManFuzzer produces test cases for an executable
based on a grammar generated from `-h`, `-H`, `--help` and
the manual page, with the option to execute those test cases.

The ManFuzzer was created by Peter Chapman in 2012.
Recently the ManFuzzer was modified and used for a [large-scale
experiment on vulnerability prediction](http://www.vdiscover.org/OS-fuzzing.html).
